# effect of changing the metric used in KNN, PCoA and Isomap
KNN, PCoA and Isomap are algorithms that use the euclidean distance. In this notebook, I replace the euclidean distance with two other metrics and look at the effect on the performance of the algorithms. Also, to compare the performance of different dimensionality reductions, I suggest a score based on the Kendall tau distance.
